                The Multistate Tax Commission is an intergovernmental state tax agency 
                working on behalf of states and taxpayers to facilitate the equitable 
                and efficient administration of state tax laws that apply to multistate 
                and multinational enterprises. Created by the Multistate Tax Compact, 
                the Commission is charged by this law with:
            </p>
            <p>
                The commission was created in 1967 as an effort by states to protect 
                their tax authority in the face of previous proposals to transfer the 
                writing of key features of state tax laws from the state legislature.  
                For that reason, the Commission has been a voice for preserving the 
                authority of states to determine their own tax policy within the limits 
                of the U.S. Constitution.
